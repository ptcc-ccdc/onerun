how you can configure `iptables`, `firewalld`, and `ufw` to allow localhost access to MySQL on port 3306:

**For iptables:**
1. Allow only localhost (127.0.0.1) to connect to MySQL (port 3306)⁴:
    ```bash
    iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s localhost --dport 3306 -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -s localhost --dport 3306 -j ACCEPT
    iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3306 -j DROP
    iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 3306 -j DROP
    ```

**For firewalld:**
1. Allow only localhost to connect to MySQL²:
    ```bash
    firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-rich-rule='
      rule family="ipv4"
      source address="127.0.0.1/32"
      port protocol="tcp" port="3306" accept'
    firewall-cmd --reload
    ```

**For ufw (Uncomplicated Firewall):**
1. Allow only localhost to connect to MySQL²:
    ```bash
    ufw allow from 127.0.0.1 to any port 3306
    ```

**MySQL Configuration:**
1. You may also need to configure MySQL to listen on localhost. This can be done by modifying the `bind-address` directive in the MySQL configuration file (usually `/etc/my.cnf` or `/etc/mysql/my.cnf`)⁵:
    ```bash
    [mysqld]
    bind-address = 127.0.0.1
    ```

Please replace `<your-port>` with the actual port number you want to allow. 

Remember to save your changes. Depending on your Linux distribution, you may use²:
- On Debian/Ubuntu:
    ```bash
    iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
    ```
- On RedHat/CentOS:
    ```bash
    service iptables save
    ```

how you can block port 22 (SSH) on iptables, firewalld, and ufw:

For iptables:

Block incoming and outgoing traffic on port 2212:
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP

For firewalld:

Remove port 22 from the list of allowed ports3:
firewall-cmd --remove-port=22/tcp --permanent
firewall-cmd --remove-port=22/udp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload

you can disable the root user (usermod -d root) and still use sudo -i


remove sudo group and make a new group to add only main user to?



where service stores its configuration and data:

1. **NGINX**: The main configuration file is typically located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`⁵. However, the exact location can depend on how NGINX was installed⁵.

2. **Apache**: Apache's configuration files are usually located at `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` or `/etc/httpd/httpd.conf`, depending on the distribution⁵. The data for websites run with Apache is typically located in `/var/www`⁷.

3. **MySQL**: By default, MySQL stores its database files in `/var/lib/mysql`⁷. The main configuration file is typically located at `/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf`⁷.

4. **Splunk**: The main configuration files for Splunk are located in the `$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/default` directory. Splunk data is stored in the directory specified in the `partitions` options in the `imapd.conf` file²⁶.

5. **NTP**: The main configuration file for NTP is located at `/etc/ntp.conf`.

6. **DNS (BIND)**: The main configuration files for BIND are located in the `/etc/bind` directory². The data is stored in the directory specified in the `directory` option in the `named.conf` file².

7. **IMAP (Dovecot)**: The main configuration files for Dovecot are located in the `/etc/dovecot` directory²⁶. The data is stored in the directory specified in the `mail_location` option in the `dovecot.conf` file²⁶.

8. **SMTP (Postfix)**: The main configuration files for Postfix are located in the `/etc/postfix` directory⁴. The data is stored in the mail queue directory, which is `/var/spool/postfix` by default⁴.
